# Calculator App
Calculator take-home assignment in built in React. 

Notes: I have never built a calculator before, so trying to build the parsing and calculating functionality was quite difficult. I initially thought of using Math.js, but decided to try and challenge myself to learn how to build this from scratch. This was a big struggle for me as I don't have a CS background and am not well-versed in data structures and algorithms. Overall it was a good learning experience, though if this role requires a more extensive CS background I may not be the best candidate.
